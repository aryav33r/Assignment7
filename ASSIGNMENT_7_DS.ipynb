        "## 1. **What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?**\n",
        "ANSWER : The feature responsible for generating Regex objects is called the \"re module\" in Python. Specifically, you use the `re.compile()` function to create a Regex (regular expression) object. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "regex_object = re.compile(r'\\d+')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. **Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : Raw strings (prefixed with 'r') are often used in Regex objects because they treat backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters rather than escape characters. This is particularly important in regular expressions where backslashes are used extensively for special sequences like `\\d`, `\\w`, `\\s`, etc. Without raw strings, you'd need to double escape these sequences (e.g., `\\\\d` instead of `\\d`).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. **What is the return value of the search() method?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : The `search()` method returns a Match object if the pattern is found in the string, or `None` if no match is found. The Match object contains information about where the match was found and what text was matched.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. **From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : You can use the `group()` method on a Match object to get the actual matched strings:\n",
        "- `match.group(0)` or `match.group()` returns the entire matched text\n",
        "- `match.group(n)` returns the nth captured group (where n ≥ 1)\n",
        "- `match.groups()` returns a tuple of all captured groups\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. **In the regex which created from the r('\\d\\n\\n-\\d\\n\\n-\\d\\n\\n\\d\\n', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : This question appears to have a typo in the regex pattern. Assuming the correct pattern is `r'(\\d)\\n\\n-(\\d)\\n\\n-(\\d)\\n\\n(\\d)\\n'`:\n",
        "- Group 0 covers the entire match (all digits and newlines)\n",
        "- Group 1 covers the first `\\d` (first digit)\n",
        "- Group 2 covers the second `\\d` (second digit after first `-`)\n",
        "- Group 3 covers the third `\\d` (third digit after second `-`)\n",
        "- There would also be a Group 4 for the last digit\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. **In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : To match literal parentheses and periods (dots), you need to escape them with a backslash:\n",
        "- `\\(` matches a literal '('\n",
        "- `\\)` matches a literal ')'\n",
        "- `\\.` matches a literal '.'\n",
        "For example, to match \"(example.com)\", you'd use: `r'\\(example\\.com\\)'`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. **The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : - If the regex has no groups, `findall()` returns a list of strings (each string is a complete match)\n",
        "- If the regex has one group, `findall()` returns a list of strings (each string is the content of that group)\n",
        "- If the regex has multiple groups, `findall()` returns a list of tuples (each tuple contains the contents of all groups)\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. **In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : The `|` character means \"OR\" in regular expressions. It allows you to specify alternatives. For example, `cat|dog` matches either \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
        "\n",
        "## 9. **In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : This question appears to be incomplete. If you're asking about the `.` character:\n",
        "- The `.` (dot) character matches any single character except a newline\n",
        "- When inside a character class `[.]`, it matches a literal dot\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10. **In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : - `+` means \"one or more\" of the preceding element (greedy)\n",
        "- `*` means \"zero or more\" of the preceding element (greedy)\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- `a+` matches \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\", etc. but not an empty string\n",
        "- `a*` matches \"\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\", etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11. **What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : - `{4}` means exactly 4 repetitions of the preceding element\n",
        "- `{4,5}` means between 4 and 5 repetitions (inclusive) of the preceding element\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- `\\d{4}` matches exactly 4 digits\n",
        "- `\\d{4,5}` matches 4 or 5 digits\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12. **What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : - `\\d` matches any decimal digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`)\n",
        "- `\\w` matches any word character (letters, digits, and underscore; equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`)\n",
        "- `\\s` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines)\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13. **What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : These are the negated versions of the previous classes:\n",
        "- `\\D` matches any character that is NOT a digit (equivalent to `[^0-9]`)\n",
        "- `\\W` matches any character that is NOT a word character (equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`)\n",
        "- `\\S` matches any character that is NOT whitespace\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14. **What is the difference between .*? and .*?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : These are greedy vs. non-greedy (lazy) quantifiers:\n",
        "- `.*` is greedy - it matches as much as possible while still allowing the overall match to succeed\n",
        "- `.*?` is non-greedy/lazy - it matches as little as possible while still allowing the overall match to succeed\n",
        "For example, in the string \"abc123def\":\n",
        "- `a.*d` would match \"abc123d\"\n",
        "- `a.*?d` would match \"abcd\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15. **What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : To match both numbers and lowercase letters using a character class, you can use:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "[a-z0-9]\n",
        "```\n",
        "This will match any single character that is either:\n",
        "- A lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z'\n",
        "- A digit between '0' and '9'\n",
        "\n",
        "Example usage:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'[a-z0-9]+')\n",
        "matches = pattern.findall('abc123XYZ456')\n",
        "# matches will be ['abc123', '456']\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 16. **What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regex case insensitive?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : There are two ways to make a regex case insensitive:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Using the `re.IGNORECASE` flag (or `re.I` for short) as the second argument to `re.compile()`:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'example', re.IGNORECASE)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Using the inline flag `(?i)` at the start of the pattern:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'(?i)example')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Both methods will make the regex match regardless of case (e.g., \"Example\", \"EXAMPLE\", \"exAmPlE\").\n",
        "\n",
        "## 17. **What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : - Normally, the `.` character matches any character **except** a newline (`\\n`).\n",
        "- When `re.DOTALL` (or `re.S`) is passed as the second argument to `re.compile()`, the `.` character will match **any character including newlines**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "\n",
        "# Without DOTALL\n",
        "pattern1 = re.compile(r'a.b')\n",
        "print(pattern1.search('a\\nb'))  # Returns None (no match)\n",
        "\n",
        "# With DOTALL\n",
        "pattern2 = re.compile(r'a.b', re.DOTALL)\n",
        "print(pattern2.search('a\\nb'))  # Returns a match\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 18. **If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : The `sub()` method will replace all matches of the pattern (`\\d+` which matches one or more digits) with 'X'. The result will be:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Breakdown:\n",
        "- '11' → 'X'\n",
        "- '10' → 'X'\n",
        "- 'five' remains unchanged (not digits)\n",
        "- '4' → 'X'\n",
        "\n",
        "## 19. **What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : `re.VERBOSE` (or `re.X`) allows you to write more readable regular expressions by:\n",
        "1. Ignoring whitespace (except when in a character class or escaped)\n",
        "2. Allowing comments (anything after a `#` to the end of the line is ignored)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is particularly useful for complex regex patterns. Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'''\n",
        "    \\d{3}    # area code\n",
        "    -         # separator\n",
        "    \\d{3}     # first 3 digits\n",
        "    -         # separator\n",
        "    \\d{4}     # last 4 digits\n",
        "''', re.VERBOSE)\n",
        "```\n",
        "This makes the regex much more readable while functioning the same as `\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It mustmatch the given following:**\n",
